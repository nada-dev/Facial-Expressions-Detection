# Facial Expressions Detection
Link to repo: https://github.com/nada-dev/Facial-Expressions-Detection.git


## Project Description
In the 1970â€™s, research work has been done for
recognizing the facial expression and they defined six
basic categories of facial expressions: sadness
,happiness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger which
has helped for the research of current expression
recognition. Antient techniques depended only on
traditional Computer vision techniques. In this code,
different approaches are used to solve the problem
using classification and detection.

## The repository structure:
The repository has The source code folder that contains
approach to the problem using 3 methods: feature generation
and image processing, second approach is involved
with neural networks, namely CNN,third approach was experimenting with
the state-of-the-art YOLO for object detection and
localization. In the paper attached with the code, 
It contains detailed description of the 3 
approaches used.
